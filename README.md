# A Day In The Life

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This is a simple photo gallery app that will show a description of each photo when the image is pressed.  Users have the ability to "like" an image by clicking on the heart button at the bottom left of each image container.  Users can also delete an image by clicking on the trash can button at the bottom right of the container.

The app has the ability to take in more photos with the form at the top of the page.  At this time, only image URL's are accepted, but upload functionality is coming soon!
